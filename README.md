# Algorithms & Data Structures - Coursework @IIT

This repository contains the coursework for the Data Structures and Algorithms module which focuses on solving sliding puzzles.

## Contents

- `PuzzleMain.java`: Main class to execute the sliding puzzle game and solve puzzles.
- `PuzzleMap.java`: Class to represent puzzle maps and load puzzle data from files.
- `PuzzleSolver.java`: Class implementing BFS algorithm to find the shortest path in the puzzle grid.
- `Node.java`: Class representing nodes in the puzzle grid and facilitating BFS traversal.

## How to Use

1. Compile the Java files using `javac`.
2. Run `PuzzleMain.java` to execute the sliding puzzle game.
3. Choose an option to load a demo of the game or select a puzzle file.
4. The program will solve the puzzle using BFS and output the steps to reach the finish.
